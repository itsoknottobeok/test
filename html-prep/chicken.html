            There really is no need to worry about anything. <br>
            Everything ALWAYS works out for the best, and <br>
            everything always arrives in its own perfect timing. <br>
            Our only job is to Let Go and Let God take over. <br>
            What's meant to be will happen, and if something is <br>
            not meant to be, it is for a reason.
